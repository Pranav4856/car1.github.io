<h5 class="car-title">GTR-r35</h5>
<p class="card-text">The GT-R packs a 3.8-litre V6 twin-turbocharged petrol, which puts out 570PS of max power at 6800rpm and 637Nm of peak torque. The engine is mated to a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission in an all-wheel-drive setup. The 2+2 seater GT-R sprints from 0-100kmph in less than 3 seconds and can hit a top speed of 315kmph.</p>

<h5 class="car-title">Mercedes Vision-avtr</h5>
<p class="card-text">In addition to an exponentially high energy density – compared to today’s battery systems with up to 1,200 Wh/litre – the technology also impresses with its exceptional fast charging capability via automated, conductive charging technology. This means that the battery will be fully recharging in less than 15 minutes. The innovative technology also allows maximum flexibility with regard to the construction space: with a local minimum of 94 millimetres, the battery adapts ideally to the shared space vehicle concept, thus maximising the multifunctional interior. 

    With a capacity of around 110 kWh, the VISION AVTR enables an electric range of more than 700 kilometres. By recuperating during roll-out and braking, the high-voltage battery can be recharged with a higher efficiency than established systems while driving and thus contributes to the high energy efficiency of the overall system. </p>

    <h5 class="car-title">Supra mk5</h5>
    <p class="card-text"> The Toyota GR Supra (model code J29/DB or A90/A91 for marketing purposes) is a sports car produced by Toyota since 2019. The fifth-generation Supra, the GR Supra was sold under and developed by Toyota Gazoo Racing (TGR) brand in collaboration with BMW. It is the successor of the A80 Supra, which ceased production in 2002.

        The GR Supra rides on a new jointly-developed sports car platform by Toyota and BMW, with a short wheelbase, wide track, and low centre of gravity, that also underpins the G29 BMW Z4.Initially, BMW considered using a pre-existing platform of their own to underpin the new Supra, to which chief engineer Tada-san declined.[11] Both cars are also manufactured at the Magna Steyr plant in Graz, Austria.[12]
        
        The fifth-generation Supra uses BMW model code conventions, designated as a J29 series with DB model codes. However, Toyota used the "A90" and "A91" code for promotional and marketing materials for the fifth-generation Supra to maintain continuity from previous Supra generations.</p>

    <h5 class="car-title">Buggati Chiron</h5>
    <p class="card-text">At the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, Bugatti unveiled the track focused version of the Chiron, named the Chiron Sport. Mechanically the car is identical to the regular version, generating 1,500 PS (1,105 kW; 1,480 hp) from a quad-turbocharged W16 engine but is 18 kg (40 lb) lighter due to the extensive use of carbon fibre and has a stiffer suspension in order to increase the cornering ability of the car while maintaining its grand touring characteristics. The steering of the car has also received modifications and a torque vectoring system to control the power sent to each wheel of the car for improved handling in tight corners has been added. Aerodynamic improvements and light weight have been given special consideration in order to keep the car competitive on the race track. The Chiron Sport became available in late 2018 for an additional US$400,000 on the standard Chiron. </p>

<h5 class="car-title">BMW i8</h5>
<p class="card-text">The BMW i8 is a plug-in hybrid sports car developed by BMW. The i8 was part of BMW's electrified fleet and was marketed under the BMW i sub-brand. The production version of the BMW i8 was unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show and was released in Germany in June 2014.[12] Deliveries to retail customers in the U.S. began in August 2014.[13] A roadster variant was launched in May 2018.[14] Production ended in June 2020.[15]

    The 2015 BMW i8 accelerated from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.4 seconds[16][17] and had an electronically limited top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph).[5] The 2015 model year i8 had a 7.1-kWh lithium-ion battery pack that delivered an all-electric range of 37 km (23 mi) under the New European Driving Cycle. Under the U.S. EPA cycle, the range in EV mode was 24 km (15 mi).[8] The battery capacity of both the BMW i8 Roadster and the i8 Coupe was increased to 11.6 kWh in 2018, allowing the NEDC electric range to rise to 55 km (34 mi) for the coupé and 53 km (33 mi) for the roadster. </p>
